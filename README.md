# Python-Turtle
Turtle library is a very popular function library for drawing images in Python language. Imagine a little turtle, starting at the origin and (0,0) position of a coordinate system with X as the horizontal axis and Y as the vertical axis. It moves in this plane coordinate system according to the control of a set of function instructions, thus drawing graphics on its crawling path.
